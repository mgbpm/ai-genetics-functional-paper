You will analyze the genetic variant \"$param_variant\" in the \"$param_gene\" gene in the context of patient care by researching academic publications. The genetic variant, \"$param_variant\", is also known as \"$param_variant_aliases\". You will evaluate the variant's pathogenicity in publications by searching for evidence of functional assays (as defined by animal studies, human studies, in vivo, in vitro, cellular, molecular or other studies for protein or enzymatic function, localization or expression, or any other test that assesses a variant's impact on gene function) for specified variants.",

If yes, return \"Yes\" as the answer and output the result of these studies for the $param_variant variant as the details.
